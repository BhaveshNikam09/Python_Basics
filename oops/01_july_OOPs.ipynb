    "1.What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "->\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a way that enhances code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. OOP achieves this by organizing software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. These objects represent instances of classes, which are blueprints for the entities, encapsulating data (attributes) and behavior (methods) within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, help in achieving this goal by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, restricting direct access to some of the object's components and promoting data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Allowing new classes to inherit properties and behavior from existing classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchical classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for methods to be used interchangeably, depending on the object's specific class type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary aspects, making the system easier to understand and maintain."

    "Class variables are attributes that are shared across all instances of a class. They are defined directly within the class body (outside any methods) and are not tied to any particular instance. This means all instances of the class share the same value for class variables unless the value is overridden at the instance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Class Variables:\n",
    "Shared across all instances: Every instance of the class has access to the same class variable, and changes to the class variable will affect all instances.\n",
    "Defined in the class body: They are defined directly within the class, outside of any instance methods.\n",
    "Used for constants or shared data: Class variables are typically used for constants or data that should be the same across all instances, such as default settings or shared configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Instance Variables\n",
    "Instance variables are attributes that are specific to each instance (object) of a class. They are defined within methods (usually within the __init__ constructor method) using the self keyword, which represents the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Instance Variables:\n",
    "Unique to each instance: Each object has its own copy of instance variables, and changes to an instance variable only affect that particular instance.\n",
    "Defined in the constructor or methods: They are typically defined inside the __init__ method or other instance methods using self.\n",

    "6.What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods:\n",
    "->\n",
    "The self parameter in Python class methods is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access instance variables (attributes) and methods from within the class, allowing each instance to maintain its own state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of the self Parameter\n",
    "Refers to the Current Instance: The self parameter refers to the instance of the class on which the method is being called. This is essential because it allows the method to know which specific object it is operating on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Instance Variables: By using self, you can access and modify the instance variables that belong to the particular instance. Each instance of a class can have different values for its instance variables, and self helps in differentiating which instance's variables are being accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Methods within the Same Class: self is used to call other methods within the same class. This is helpful for creating complex behaviors that rely on multiple methods working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing between Class and Instance Attributes: Since Python does not have explicit syntax to differentiate between class and instance variables, self makes it clear that a method or variable belongs to an instance rather than the class itself."
